# nft-preview-card
## issues i came across and how i tackled them
- I used CSS Flexbox to place and set my card to the center of the webpage and using flex-box also outrightly made it mobile responsive without me having to use media queries.
- I had to use an overlay effect in my image so when being hovered over gives out a [##view-icon], which i set my two images in an img-wrapper and then did all the overlay the code is right there you can check it to get a better understaning...
